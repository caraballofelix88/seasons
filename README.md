### TODO

- Add multiple text rendering methods for playing w sizes
  - refine sizes for displays and layouts
- colors are pretty ugly still
- think up some slick animations and layouts
- setup for published package
- still gonna have issues rendering non-unicode romaji
- sort out webp size jank, keep image output consistent
  - just changing the colors of the kanji imgs is preventing push
